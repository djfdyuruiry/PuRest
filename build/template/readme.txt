Pu(R)est Web Server
===================

Before running for the first time make sure all the Visual C++ Runtimes in the redist folder are installed as Lua and C Libraries Pu(R)est uses requires them.

Also, make sure the environment variable "PUREST_DIR" points to the installation directory where you unzipped all the sever files.

- Start the server by running the startServer.bat file.

- If you want to configure the server edit the cfg.lua file in the cfg dir. (DefaultConfig.lua is in '/lua/Config' as an example and a backup if you mess up)

- Note if you want to select your own HTML directory copy the sessions.s3db in the web directory to your new HTML directory
